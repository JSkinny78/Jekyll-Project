Welcome to the Now page.
<br />
Right now I am a student at murray state working on understanding the intricacies of Jekyll
It has taken me some getting used to but I am getting the hang of it.
<br />
I am also in the design phase of my senior project. A to be named video game set in a world of my own making.
<br />
Plans for the future either include game development or software development depending on when and where I end up. The pro's and con's for both are still up for debate.
